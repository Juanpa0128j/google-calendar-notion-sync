What is node-red?
=================
According to [the website](https://nodered.org/):
> Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.
>It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-click.

But among other things, it is in fact an amazing tool for quick prototyping many things.
